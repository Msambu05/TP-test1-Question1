Planning: In this initial phase, project goals, scope, feasibility, and resources are identified and defined. Key activities include conducting feasibility studies, defining project objectives, creating project plans, and allocating resources.

Analysis: During this phase, stakeholders' needs and requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This involves understanding the current system (if applicable), identifying deficiencies, and defining the desired features and functionalities of the new system.

Design: In the design phase, the system architecture, components, interfaces, and data structures are designed based on the requirements identified in the previous phase. This includes creating system specifications, architectural diagrams, user interface designs, and database schemas.

Implementation: Also known as the development phase, implementation involves the actual coding or building of the software system based on the design specifications. Developers write code, create databases, integrate components, and conduct unit testing to ensure that individual modules function correctly.

Testing: The testing phase is dedicated to verifying and validating the software to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. Various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT), are conducted to identify defects and ensure the quality of the software.

Deployment: Once the software has been thoroughly tested and approved by stakeholders, it is deployed into the production environment. This involves installing the software, configuring it for operational use, and migrating data from existing systems if necessary.

Maintenance: The maintenance phase involves ongoing support and maintenance activities to address issues, fix defects, and make enhancements to the software. This includes monitoring system performance, providing user support, applying updates, and responding to change requests.
